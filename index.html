    <h2>Understanding Financial Planning</h2>
    <p>Financial planning is the process of managing your finances to achieve personal life goals. It involves evaluating your current financial situation, setting goals for the future, and creating strategies to meet those goals. Key areas include budgeting, saving, investing, retirement planning, tax management, and estate planning. A good financial plan provides clarity on income, expenses, and savings, helping you prepare for life events and secure your financial future. The aim is to optimize the use of your resources while mitigating risks and preparing for unforeseen challenges.</p>
